  <!-- **Welcome to my academic homepage!** -->

  <!-- I am a graduate researcher at the University of Maryland, College Park.  -->
  <br>
  My research interests lie in the intersection of 3D Vision, Computer Graphics and Deep Learning with an application domain of scientific visualization and mixed reality (AR/VR/XR). I have been primarily working with [Prof. Matthias Zwicker](https://www.cs.umd.edu/~zwicker/) on real-time neural point cloud rendering for scientific visualization and [Prof. Jia-bin Huang](https://jbhuang0604.github.io/) on photo-geometric factors in 2D generative models.

  <br>

  Previously, I was a researcher at Innovation Labs, Tata Consultancy Services collaborating with [Dr. Lovekesh Vig](https://sites.google.com/site/lovekeshhome/) and [Ms. Ramya Hebbalaguppe](https://in.linkedin.com/in/ramya-hebbalaguppe-620b272). I completed my undergrad in Computer Science and Engineering at Indraprastha Institute of Information Technology Delhi (IIITD). At IIITD, I was fortunate to work with [Prof. Saket Anand](http://faculty.iiitd.ac.in/~anands/) and [Prof. Ojaswa Sharma](http://faculty.iiitd.ac.in/~ojaswa/) on interesting problems of scene reconstruction and procedural modelling.
