# This config file is meant for settings that affect your whole blog, values

# yourself editing this file very often, consider using Jekyll's data files
# feature for the data you need to update frequently.
#
# For technical reasons, this file is *NOT* reloaded automatically when you use
# 'bundle exec jekyll serve'. If you change this file, please restart the server process.

# Site settings
# These are used to personalize your new site. If you look in the HTML files,
# you will see them accessed via {{ site.title }}, {{ site.email }}, and so on.
# You can create any custom variable you would like, and they will be accessible
# in the templates via {{ site.myvariable }}.

  I am working with [Prof. Sotirios Nousias](https://sotirisnousias.com/) at the intersection of 3D vision, computational imaging, and computer graphics. Previously, I worked on efficient neural rendering solutions for point cloud visualization with [Prof. Matthias Zwicker](https://www.cs.umd.edu/~zwicker/) at the University of Maryland College Park. I was also a researcher at [TCS Research](https://www.tcs.com/what-we-do/research) where I explored deep learning solutions for AR with [Dr. Lovekesh Vig](https://sites.google.com/site/lovekeshhome/) and [Ms. Ramya Hebbalaguppe](https://rhebbalaguppe.github.io).
